# Project 2: More Data, More Visualizations

For this project, the students will:
* find a data set of their choosing
* get approval from the instructor to use that data set
* upon approval, find another (related) data set
* join the new data set with the original one to create an "enriched" data set
* perform an open-ended Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the enriched data set

Regarding the last bullet, "open-ended" means the student chooses the EDA that is performed. The student should have at least three types of data analysis (e.g., mean, standard deviation) and at least three types of graphs (e.g., historgram, bar graph). The student will explain why those variables were chosen for numerical or graphical analysis. Finally, the student will make note of any unusual values for any variable that is analyzed.
# Loan Book Analysis Project
This project aims to explore and analyze the trend of a loan book of a certain bank. The following points outline the key aspects covered in this analysis:
# Importing Libraries:
import pandas as pd: Imports the Pandas library and assigns it the alias pd. Pandas is a powerful library for data manipulation and analysis. import numpy as np: Imports the NumPy library and assigns it the alias np. NumPy is used for numerical operations on arrays and matrices. import matplotlib.pyplot as plt: Imports the pyplot module from the Matplotlib library and assigns it the alias plt. Matplotlib is a popular plotting library. import seaborn as sns: Imports the Seaborn library and assigns it the alias sns. Seaborn is built on top of Matplotlib and provides a high-level interface for statistical graphics.
# Data exploration
Summary statistics, visualizations, and interpretive text describing the distribution of the principal balance.
# Visualization
Includes 6 polished visualizations of relevant findings.

# Exploring Correlation

Exploring Correlation Exploring correlation between amount of loan disbursed and count of disbursement and impact

# Data Visualization

Data Visualization Incorporates eight refined visualizations that illustrate trends and relationships among various variables

# Trend
Includes the movement of principal balances and loan amounts from 2010 to date
